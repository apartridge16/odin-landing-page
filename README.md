# odin-landing-page

This project is going to bring together elements of html and css that i've learned and hopefully create a nice looking landing page fro a website. I'm still not fully comfortable with css, there are a lot of elements I dont understand and will probably have to do quite a bit of googling. 



Just finished the project. I still dont feel like I fully understand everything. May have to go back and look throught the flexbox exercises. However, I got it to look like the pictures, so im counting that as a win.
